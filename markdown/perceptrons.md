[Perceptrons Explained](https://owenshen24.github.io/perceptron/) is an explorable in the same vein as those popularized by [Nicky Case](https://explorabl.es/). Basically, t's an essay with fancy interactive graphs.

You can play with several perceptron variants and explore how this basic machine learning algorithm adapts to changes in the data like size, noise, and margin. Specifically, the normal perceptron, Maxover algorithm, and Voted Perceptron are all explored. The code is on [GitHub]().
