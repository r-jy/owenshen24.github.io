Perceptrons Explained is an [explorable](https://explorabl.es/) intending to be in the same vein as those popularized by [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me). Basically, it's an essay with fancy interactive graphs.

You can play (and learn about!) the normal perceptron, Maxover algorithm, and the Voted Perceptron. There are tweakable parameters for the number of data points, noise level, and margin. The project is made with d3.js, and the perceptron models are written in JavaScript.
