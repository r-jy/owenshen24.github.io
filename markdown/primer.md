Aside from mindlevelup, I've also written some more long-form essays, accompanied by a crew of quirky graphics. You can find them on Wordpress below (I'm in the process of moving them to here):

[Habits 101](https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/mindlevelup-the-book/habits-101/) is an overview of how to make habits, break habits, and make the changes stick.

[Planning 101](https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/mindlevelup-the-book/planning-101/9) is an overview of why we're overconfident when planning and how to calibrate better.

[Attractor Theory](https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/mindlevelup-the-book/attractor-theory/) is a quirky mental model of motivation that combines willpower with environmental factors, as well as flow-through effects.

[The Ancient God Who Rules High School](https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/the-ancient-god-who-rules-high-school/) is about misaligned incentives in the US high school system as well as Moloch, the god of the tragedy of the commons.
