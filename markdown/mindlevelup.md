mindlevelup is an ongoing sequence of blog posts that aim to distill productivity and self-help concepts into crystallized essays.

The blog used to be hosted on [Wordpress](https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/), but I've now migrated to a nifty static site generator I wrote in Python. The GitHub link featues both the static site generator as well as the blog posts.

If you want an older version to take on the go, I've also written a free [book](pdfs/ratbook.pdf) that clocks in at ~150 pages, which explores similar content.
