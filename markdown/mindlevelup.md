[mindlevelup](https://mlu.red/) is an ongoing sequence of blog posts that distill productivity into crystallized concepts.

The blog used to be hosted on [Wordpress](https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/), but I've now migrated to a nifty static site generator in Python of my own design. The code for both the blog posts and the generator can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/owenshen24/golb/).

If you want an older version of the content on mindlevelup, you can read a book that's adapted from some of the blog posts [here](pdfs/ratbook.pdf)(~150 pages).
