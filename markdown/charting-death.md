Charting Death is a data science project that examines the ways we die and compares that to newspaper mentions of the aforementioned causes of death. As one might expect, it turns out the certain causes of death (heart disease, kidney disease) are underrepresented in the news and others (homicide, terrorism) are overrepresented.
